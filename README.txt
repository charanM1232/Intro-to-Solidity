# My-work
I am starting a journal of all the coding practice, projects, and work I have completed to build up my skillset.
Hello, my name is Charan Malisetti and this is my digital log for all the projects I do in order to
develop the skills necessary to become a blockchain developer

I want to complete these three goals by August 2024 (Start date: March 2024)

**Goal #1:**
Learn the fundementals of the language solidity and develop smart contracts. Test these smart contracts and deploy one into the actual blockchain

**Goal #2:**
Understand how to use DeFi platform API's such as uniSwap and integrate it into my own smart contracts

**Goal #3:**
Develop my very own arbitrage trading bot that can execute transactions between two exchanges, and upload it on cloud. 
    There is no point in me copying and pasting code I find on the internet because I want to hone my own skills.
